# GPT-2 Reimplementation README

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains a reimplementation of OpenAI's **GPT-2** model from scratch. The goal is to understand and reproduce the core functionalities of GPT-2, including **tokenization, transformer architecture, training, and inference**.

## 🧠 Understanding GPT-2
GPT-2 is an **autoregressive Transformer model** designed for **text generation**. It consists of:
- **Multi-layer Transformer blocks**
- **Self-attention for contextual word understanding**
- **Layer normalization and residual connections**
- **Token embeddings and positional encodings**
